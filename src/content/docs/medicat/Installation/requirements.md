## Supported Drives

**Any Drive 32 GB or larger is supported by Medicat.**

## Recommendations

We **strongly** suggest using a USB 3.0 or above as using USB 2 will **severely** dampen the speed of your install and some tools may fail to boot.

That being said Medicat will boot with computer that only has 2.0 slots.

Matt And Jayro strongly suggest using a USB SSD enclosure if you plan to use Medicat on a semi regular basis.

## Compatibility

- Windows 10/11 (Insider builds might break the installer)
- Ubuntu / Arch / Debian / CentOS / FreeBSD / Fedora

## Requirements for Windows

- Windows 1703+ (releases after 2017)
- cURL
- Half a brain

## Requirements for Linux

- Terminal
- Like 75% of a brain
- General Linux Knowledge
