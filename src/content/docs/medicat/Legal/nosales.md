# No Sales or Payments Policy

## We Do NOT Sell Anything

This website does **NOT** sell any products, services, or software. All resources, downloads, and information provided here are **completely free of charge**.

## MediCat USB is Always Free

MediCat USB is a free, community-driven project. You will **never** be required to pay for access to MediCat USB or any related downloads from this site.

- **If you are asked to pay for MediCat USB, it is not legitimate.**
- The only exception is **optional donations** to support the project, which are always voluntary and never required for access.

## Donations

We may accept donations to help support the ongoing development and hosting of MediCat USB. Donations are entirely optional and do not grant access to exclusive features or downloads.

## Beware of Scams

If you encounter anyone or any website asking for payment in exchange for MediCat USB, please be aware that this is **not authorized** and may be a scam.

## Contact

If you have questions or concerns about payments or donations, please contact us through the official channels listed on this website.

## About eBay and Third-Party Sellers

We are aware that some individuals and sellers on platforms like eBay and other marketplaces offer USB drives with MediCat USB pre-installed, often charging for the physical USB itself rather than the software (which is free).

- **We do NOT endorse, support, or affiliate with any of these sellers.**
- These sellers operate in a legal grey area by charging for the hardware, not the software.
- We cannot prevent third parties from distributing MediCat USB in this way, but we strongly discourage purchasing from them.
- Buying from these sellers does not support the project, and we cannot guarantee the authenticity, safety, or quality of what you receive.

For the safest and most up-to-date experience, we recommend downloading MediCat USB directly from our official channels and creating your own USB drive. 

## Trademarks and Third-Party Software

MediCat USB includes various third-party software tools, each of which is the property of its respective developer or company. We have **not communicated with, received endorsement from, or partnered with** the developers of any third-party software bundled with MediCat USB.

- **Do not contact the original developers of bundled software for support regarding copies included with MediCat USB.** They are not responsible for issues arising from use within this project.
- All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners. Use of these names does not imply any affiliation or endorsement.
