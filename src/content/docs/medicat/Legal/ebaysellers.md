## Why eBay Sellers Are a Problem

We have seen countless eBay sellers and other online resellers charging outrageous prices for MediCat USB, a project that is—and always will be—**100% free**. These sellers simply download our free software, put it on the cheapest USB drives they can find, and sell it to unsuspecting buyers for a huge markup. They do not support the project, and you are NOT getting anything special or official by buying from them.

- **You are paying for something you can get for free.**
- **You are likely getting a low-quality, unreliable USB drive.**
- **You are NOT supporting the developers or the community.**

## Risks of Buying MediCat from eBay

- **Fake or outdated versions:** Sellers may provide old, tampered, or even malware-infected copies.
- **Cheap, unreliable USB drives:** Many use the lowest quality drives, risking data loss and failed installs.
- **No support or warranty:** You get no help from us or potentially even the seller if something goes wrong.
- **Wasted money:** You pay far more than the cost of making your own, for a worse product.

## How to Get MediCat Safely (For Free!)

- Download the latest, official version directly from our [official website](https://medicatusb.com/#downloads)
- Follow our guides to create your own USB drive using a quality, brand-name drive you trust.
- Join our community for free support and updates.

## What to Do If You Already Bought from eBay

- **Demand a refund:** If you feel misled, request a refund from the seller or through eBay's buyer protection.
- **Test your USB drive:** Use tools like [H2testw](https://h2testw.org/) or [FakeFlashTest](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/fakeflashtest.html) to check for fake or faulty drives.
- **Warn others:** Leave honest feedback and help others avoid the same mistake.
